# defi_yield_stake_web3js_hardhat

Created an erc20 token and a token farm. People can stake their tokens in the token farm, get yield, and also they can retrieve their tokens.

For deploying the contracts I used `hardhat`, `hardhat-deploy`, `webjs`, and `etherjs`. For testing I used `mocha` and `chai`.
